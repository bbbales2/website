         <div class="section">
           <div class="title">Introduction</div>
           <p>
             The goal of this article is to describe how to use Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature detectors to quantitatively analyze microstructure changes in superalloys.
           </p>

           <p>
             Let me start by explaining what superalloys are and why we care about analyzing their microstructural differences. After that I'll introduce the Histogram of Oriented Gradients and do some example analyses.
           </p>

           <p>
             Superalloys are metals used in high temperature applications, primarily gas turbines (for power generation, etc.) . The higher temperature those turbines operate, the higher efficiency they can be. In practice, turbines can operate at 1000+ degrees C, so superalloys research orbits around improving that number.
           </p>

           <p>
<!-- Now, the microstructure is not the whole story mechanically. It's not possible to just take a micrograph of a superalloy and know all of its physical properties, but it can reveal interesting information.-->
             A superalloy's mechanical strength is tightly coupled to its microstructure. <a class="ref" data-ref="basic_superalloy"></a> shows a basic superalloy microstructure micrograph. The distinctive pattern in that image is colloquially called a "brick and mortar" microstructure. Now, if a sample has been in operation too long, the microstructure can "raft" and go from something like in the previous image to something like <a class="ref" data-ref="basic_rafted_superalloy"></a>. So if we see samples with rafted microstructures, qualitatively we know they've been in operation too long and could have been ready to fail.
           </p>

           <p>
             One of the things that we're attempting to do in this article is quantitatively analyze transformations like that. If we can take a sample, take a picture of it, and somehow estimate its operating conditions, that will be pretty cool. Even though turbine operators will have a vague idea of the time of operation for parts in their system, the exact thermo-mechanical loads are basically unknown. Backing out the real operating conditions (temperature and load) is super useful.
           </p>

               <div class="caption">This is your basic superalloy microstructure. It's a ReneN5 sample. As with basically all superalloys, you'd use it somewhere in a turbine.</div>

             </div>
           </div>

           <p>
             Another experiment we may want to do is quantify how changes in alloy composition change their microstructure. This is shown in <a class="ref" data-ref="molybdenum_sample"></a>. The percent composition of Molybdenum was varied in each sample (by just a few tenths of percentage points). The dramatic changes in microstructure are evident. Understanding how the different compositions result in different microstructures is important in designing alloys.
           </p>

           <p>
             In other cases it may simply be useful to compare microstructures from different alloys, for instance comparing <a class="ref" data-ref="renen4"></a>, a micrograph of Rene N4, a superalloy used in turbine blades, to <a class="ref" data-ref="rene88"></a>, an image of Rene88, a superalloy used in turbine cores.

             </div>
           </div>

           <p>
             In any case, analyzing microstructures is interesting and is a problem that has been studied before. Most microstructure analysis consist of a segmentation followed by some sort of structural analysis of that segmentation. Segmentation is the process of turning the microstructure micrograph into a binary image with either zero or one indicating precense of gamma or gamma-prime at a pixel (if you're curious about segmentation, <a href="/seg/index.html">read this</a>). After an image is segmented, folks measure physical properties of the segmented precipitates. The idea is by measuring enough of these precipitates it would be possible to build meaningful statistical tools to answer all the questions posed above.
           </p>

           <p>
             The problem with segmentations is they are difficult. Even though superalloys images are relatively easy to segment relative to other segmentation problems, it's still not trivial, and generating consistent segmentations that are good enough for numerical analysis is difficult.
           </p>

           <div class="title">Histogram of Oriented Gradients</div>

           <p>
             The big reveal of this article is: we can use this thing called a Histogram of Oriented Gradients to do microstructure analysis without segmentations.
           </p>

           <p>
             A Histogram of Oriented Gradients (henceforth referred to as a HOG) plots the relative strengths of gradients in an image pointing in different directions. This is best understood with a plot. <a class="ref" data-ref="HOGdemo_1"></a> shows an image along with its HOG. As can be seen, the HOG has for strong peaks. Those peaks point in the normal directions of the cubic precipitates in the image. In <a class="ref" data-ref="HOGdemo_2"></a> we have spherical precipitates instead of cubic precipitates and see that the HOG is unformly distributed. This makes sense because the normals for the spherical precipitates are evently distributed as well.
           </p>

           <p>
             We can do other experiments as well, <a class="ref" data-ref="HOGdemo_3"></a> shows how rafting can be easily detected with a HOG.

           </div>

           <div class="title">Computing a HOG</div>

           <p>
             HOGs are easy to compute. The steps are:
           </p>
           
           <ol>
             <li>Compute the gradient of the image at every point</li>
             <li>For each pixel, the gradient can be represented as two values, an angle and a magnitude</li>
             <li>Accumulate in a histogram the magnitude of the gradient at each pixel in the bin that corresponds to the angle of that gradient</li>
           </ol>

           <p>
             Like I said before, this gets rid of the segmentation. Basically, as long as its possible to compute a reasonable image gradient, then the HOG is easy to compute. Computing a gradient in most images comes down to blurring the image a little (with a Gaussian blur) and computing finite differences. It's usually very easy to pick the parameters for this process, which is not a luxury we have in segmentation.
           </p>

           <p>
             Some example code for computing HOGs is available on Github: <a href="hogexample.py">here</a>.
           </p>

           <p>
             Scikit Image has some actual HOG feature detectors <a href="http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.feature.html#skimage.feature.hog">here</a>.
           </p>

           <div class="title">How to Describe Transformations Quantitatively</div>
           
           <p>
             So it's easy to qualitatively describe differences in microstructures using HOGs, but to make these feature descriptors actually useful we need to make these comparisons quantitative (after all it's easy to qualitatively compare microstructures without the HOGs).
           </p>

           <p>
             A simple way of doing this is to take the FFT of the HOG and look at the magnitudes of the responses in each of the different bins. The easiest way to understand this is by thinking about idealized microstructures and how our measured HOGs compare to them. An ideal spherical microstructure will produce an entirely uniform HOG. The FFT of a constant is a non-zero value in the zeroeth frequency bin of the FFT and zeros in every other non-zero frequency bin. Likewise, an idealized cubic microstructure will produce a HOG with four non-zero peaks (one at 0 degrees, one at 90 degrees, one at 180 degrees, and one at 270 degrees). The magnitude of the FFT of this signal is a non-zero value at every fourth non-zero frequency bin of the FFT. We also looked at feature descriptors computed from every second non-zero frequency bin: From these two idealized descriptions, we come up with two scores:
           </p>

           <ol>
             <li>
               "Sphericalness" is defined as the energy in the zero-eth frequency bin of the FFT divided by the energy in all non-zero frequency bins. An ideal spherical microstructure returns a value of infinity, and a totally random signal returns a value of 1 / number_of_bins_in_fft. A higher number is a more spherical microstructure in this case.
             </li>
             <li>
               "Cubicness" is defined as the energy in every fourth non-zero frequency bin of the FFT divided by the energy in all other non-zero frequency bins. An ideal cubic microstructure has a value of infinity, and a totally random signal has a value of 0.25. A higher number is more cubic.
             </li>
             <li>
               "Raftedness" is defined as the energy in every second non-zero frequency bin of the FFT divided by the energy in all other non-zero frequency bins. An ideal cubic microstructure has a value of infinity, and a totally random signal has a value of 0.5. A higher number is more rafted. Note, a high "Cubicness" score will give a high "Raftedness" score.
             </li>
           </ol>

           <p>
             A simplified diagram of the process described above is shown in <a class="ref" data-ref="exampleHOGFFT"></a>. In this diagram, a slight modification of "Cubicness" was used where only the amount of energy in every fourth frequency bin that has the same phase as the signal in the fourth non-zero frequency bin. This is practically a slight adjustment but reflects the idea that the phases of the non-zero values of the FFT of a delta train are the same.

           <div class="title">More dimensions, more problems</div>

           <p>
             It's easy to extend the HOG to higher dimensions. The histogram is simply done in two dimensions instead of one. Depending on the projection the numbers can look different, but the interpretation is the same. <a class="ref" data-ref="HOG3d"></a> shows two different 3D HOGs. The actual 3D plot is difficult to read, but the 2D projection has some inaccuracies. However, for the cubic microstructure, we see six strong peaks in the HOG corresponding to the six faces of the precipitates in the sample.
           </p>

           <div class="imgDiv">
             <div class="img HOG3d">
               <img src="static/images/HOG3d.png">
               <div class="caption">This is a TEM.</div>
             </div>
           </div>

           <p>
             Quantifying the 3D HOGs is a little trickier than quantifying the 2D ones. The 3D analog to the FFT is the spherical harmonics transform. Unfortunately it is somewhat trickier to work with, but it's still possible to build a rotation invariant feature descriptor to discriminate between spherical and non-spherical precipitates.
           </p>

           <p>
             The main dataset I did experiments on with HOGs in 3D was a simulated dataset from Dr. Yunzhi Wang [cite the paper].

           <p>
             There are also other descriptors to analyze. In 3D, we found it useful to, given a HOG, assume that HOG is a thin-shell of material and compute the moments of inertia of that thin shell. This stems from the qualitative discussions of lobed-ness in 2D earlier. If the HOG has six strong lobes, it is cubic. This is because, if the cubes are aligned, most of the normals in the dataset will point in six directions. Through similar logic, if it has four lobes, it is columnar and if it has two lobes it is planar.
           </p>

           <p>
             The mass moments of inertia are sensitive to whether an object is six lobed, four lobed, or two lobed. For a six lobed object, the difficulty of rotating the object around any of the primary axes is the same. For a four lobed object, rotation around one axis (the one without a lobe) is significantly harder than the other two. For a two lobed object, rotation around the primary axis of the lobes is much easier than either of the off axes. It's easy to detect a transformation by watching how these primary moments differ.
